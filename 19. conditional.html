      /*
        Suppose at a University where there are 5 modules/subjects 
        and passing marks for each subject is 60. To be promoted to 
        the next class a student must atleast pass 4 subjects. Also his 
        average marks should not be less than 60. Write an app to 
        prompt the user for inputting marks in 5 subjects and print his 
        average marks , number of subjects he has passed and finally 
        whether he is promoted to the next class or not
        */

      var mark4 = parseFloat(prompt("Enter marks for subject 4"));
      var mark5 = parseFloat(prompt("Enter marks for subject 5"));

      // Calculate average marks
